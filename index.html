      <p>
        Hello, My name is Yuhao Chen, and I am a sophomore majoring in AGPM. I
        am very passionate with product management, right now I am working on
        several independent projects. I know all of you are very talented, and I
        could really use a hand. If you want colab email me at:
        ychen514@ucsc.edu. I am currently working remotely from China, so I
        usually available any time after 6PM PT.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently working on an iOS game, and it is technologically unique
        because it uses UI frameworks like SwiftUI instead of Game framework
        like SpriteKit. So if you are into iOS development, we should definitely
        work together. Design wise, ton of efforts have been put into this
        project. For starter, I custom made an entire font just for this
        project. Recently, I finished stage two design for this project, and it
        involves significantly more works than the initial stage. This workload
        is little overwhelming, so once again, I really could use your help if
        you are into this kind of things.
